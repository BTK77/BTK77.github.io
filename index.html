                    <p> Allow me to introduce myself. My name is <b>Bader Karam</b>.
                        I am an international student hailing all the way from the Middle East, specifically from <b>Kuwait</b>.
                        I bet you wouldn't have guessed that and it's no suprise since most of my teachers in Kuwait have never even heard of Kuwait until they were hired.
                        I am also a <b>Computer Engineering Major (CPE)</b> and am interested in the hardware and software of technology.
                    </p>
                    <p> This isn't my first attempt at a wesbite. I made an e-commerce website using Wordpress. Which, admittedly is more easier than HTML or CSS.
                        Most websites use HTML and CSS, so I want to learn and gain experience in this field, more than I already have. 
                        I would like to be a part of the good future. I want everyone who has interacted with me to have positivity imapcted on them, and I guess this is my
                        first impression.
